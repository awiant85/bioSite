      <p>"Danika Ritger is a driven individual who brings positivity into every room she enters. She was born in Ormond Beach, Florida, and spent part of her childhood in Virginia Beach before returning to her hometown. Today, she lives in Davenport, Florida, where she juggles both school and work with dedication. She is currently earning her second bachelor's degree in Marketing, having already completed a degree in Hospitality. Her ultimate goal is to build a career in marketing for a theme park company, ideally in a remote position that allows her to bring her ideas to life from the comfort of home.
        Danika works at Walt Disney World as a Monorail Trainer and Coordinator. In this role, she helps guide new Cast Members and ensures guest safety and satisfaction. She loves the Monorail for its iconic presence and the way it connects people to the heart of the Disney experience. Working at Disney has fueled her passion for creating meaningful guest moments and inspired her to pursue a future in themed entertainment marketing.
        One of Danika’s biggest passions is running. She regularly participates in runDisney races and thrives on the high-energy environment of race day. Themed medals, exciting courses, and the chance to run alongside friends and family make the experience unforgettable. One of her goals is to take on the Dopey Challenge, which involves running a 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon on four consecutive days. Danika also enjoys expressing her creativity through crafting. She uses her Cricut to design custom shirts and stickers, especially for races and special events. She loves building LEGO sets and visiting Florida’s theme parks on the weekends.
        From her dedication to fitness and creativity to her commitment to spreading joy through every project, Danika is someone who leads with passion and kindness. Whether she is training on the Monorail, exploring a theme park, or dreaming of future travels to places like Paris, Danika is always moving forward with heart and purpose.
